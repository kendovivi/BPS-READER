I want to show only system.out.println messages to logcat from my currently running application. I have already checked many suggestions from stack overflow and others. But all I got is suggestions like " add adb -d logcat com.example.example:I :S"... etc. But I don't know where to add this. I know how to open logcat filter settings window. It shows items named 'filter name', 'by log tag', 'by log message', 'by PID', 'by application name', and 'by log level'.
One more thing. I have added a filter with "^(?!.(nativeGetEnabledTags)).*$" in the 'by log message' item and managed to avoid the flooding of logcat window by a message like "unexpected value from nativegetenabledtags". But the problem was, I have to add this all the time whenever I run an application(even if it is the same program) in eclipse. Is there any way to add filters for permanently?

I have added a filter with "^(?!.(nativeGetEnabledTags)).*$" in the 'by log message' item and managed to avoid the flooding of logcat window by a message like "unexpected value from nativegetenabledtags". But the problem was, I have to add this all the time whenever I run an application(even if it is the same program) in eclipse. Is there any way to add filters for permanently?
Thanks in advance...I want to show only system.out.println messages to logcat from my currently running application. I have already checked many suggestions from stack overflow and others. But all I got is suggestions like " add adb -d logcat com.example.example:I :S"... etc. But I don't know where to add this. I know how to open logcat filter settings window. It shows items named 'filter name', 'by log tag', 'by log message', 'by PID', 'by application name', and 'by log level'.
